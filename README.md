## Usage with JIRA
Create branch from Jira issue use "qs dev https://untill.atlassian.net/browse/Issue-Number"
Example:
```
1. qs dev https://untill.atlassian.net/browse/AIR-270
```
In order it works define the following env variables:
- JIRA_EMAIL=[user email]
- JIRA_API_TOKEN=[user jira api token] - it's genertated [here]([url](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)).

If JIRA_EMAIL is not defined qs tries to get it from local git settings.
If it's not defined, qs gives error "Error: Please export JIRA_EMAIL."
If JIRA_API_TOKEN is not found, qs gives error:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: JIRA API token not found. Please set environment variable JIRA_API_TOKEN.
            Jira API token can generate on this page:
          https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

2. "qs pr" creates Pull Request with link on Jira issue.
  
> **Note**
  - `qs u` takes comment from clipboard. If current branch is "main/master", 
           and message is empty or very short (<3 symbols), qs willask to enter message.
           If the message is too short, it shows error:   
                  ----  Too short comment not allowed! --- 

## Prevent large commits

Command 'qs dev' creates a developer branch and after success, it shows the following question:

```
   Git pre-commit hook, preventing commit large files does not exist.
   Do you want to set hook(y/n)?
```

- On 'y', qs creates github local pre-commit hook script for current repository.

If local pre-commit hook found, 'qs dev' does not asks to create the hook.
